# Travis R Scott
## About Me
My name is Travis, I'm from Lynnwood, WA, born and raised. I started my career path in pharmacy but after trying out different aspects of that career field I learned that it didn't stimulate what i was looking for in a career path. When researching what is important, I found software engineering was a perfect match for a creative outlet and problem solving to keep my mind stimulated. I found General Assembly though a personal friend and mentor. When starting the program, it was a stressful, interesting new world that I was excited to immerse myself in. While I knew it would be challenging with work and personal life, I didn't want to wait. It has helped me push myself past what I believed I was capable of and can't wait to put the skills I've learned in action.
When I'm not working, I like anything to do with games. I like playing sports, especially football, I play on a flag football team and also just with friends anytime I can. Also watch football every chance I get and play fantasy football. When I want a relaxing day with friends at home i'll play some board games all night. If I'm at home alone, I'll just play some video games. Going to the gym is also something I try to do anytime I have free time. Cooking is something I try do get better at and do as much as I can.
